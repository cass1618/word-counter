Compare each word in sentenceArray to each word in badArray
Both arrays could have a different number of words

Could find the size of array and then do a for loop to iterate through each index

Or use a nested forEach loop

For the outer loop use forEach to go through each of the sentenceArray words

Inside the loop we have a single word

Loop inside this will go through all the badArray words
and compare to the word from the outer loop
